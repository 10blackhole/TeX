The object I choose is my tablet. Obviously it does not have a name. I bought it approximately 4 years ago because at that time I needed to do assistantships at my old university. The truth it was some expensive, at least for me, and that's why, at first, I did not know if it was really worth it, but over time I was used to it and convinced myself that it was really worth buying. As for its size, I would say it is optimal, since it occupies the same space as a conventional notebook and allows me to carry it everywhere in my backpack.

I choose this object to speak because I realized that it accompanies me day by day. I literally do everything with it, from watching videos, playing some video games, studying, taking notes, reading papers among other things. Also it has allowed me to stop buying notebooks, because it allows me to have all the notes of different topics in one place, even random calculations which are easy to lose if they were written on sheets.
